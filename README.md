# 🏥 MediCore – Unified Hospital & Health Record Management System (UHHMS)

## Overview
Most hospitals today operate independently with isolated databases. When a patient visits a new hospital, previous medical records are unavailable, causing delays, repeated tests, and increased healthcare costs.

MediCore provides a unified, secure platform to connect hospitals, laboratories, and pharmacies using a shared backend.
